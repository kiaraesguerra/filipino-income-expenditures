    "In this section, we will perform data grouping based on regions. Grouping the data per region allows us to explore regional disparities, identify unique economic conditions, and understand how family income and expenditures vary across different parts of the country. We seek to answer the following questions:\n",

    "1. What are the regions with the highest and lowest average family income?\n",
    "2. How do family expenditures differ across regions?\n",
    "3. What are the major expense categories for families in different regions?\n",
    "4. Is there a correlation between family income and certain types of expenditures?\n",
    "5. Are there any significant outliers in the data that indicate unique economic conditions in certain regions?"

This may also be explained by more expensive food preferences of the residents, i.e. having higher meat and fruits expenditures, which tend to be more expensive than food staples such as bread, cereals, and rice.\n",

Furthermore, the urban lifestyle (which gets really busy) may also result in more frequent dining out.\n",

Although NCR is considered highly urbanized, work and school can be in a city different from one's residence. For instance, Malabon is a city in NCR also considered as highly urbanized, with a lot of job opportunities, but some residents still have a preference for jobs/universities in QC, Manila, Makati, etc., because the jobs are usually blue collar, contractual, or \"arawan\", while schools are limited to community colleges.\n",
