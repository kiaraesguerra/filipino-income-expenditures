This repository contains the analytics pipeline for the Filipino Family Income and Expenditures dataset, acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) which was gathered by the Philippine Statistics Authority. The data will be analysed from a regional perspective. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is first performed to gain insights that will guide model building. One of the main strategies of this project would be to categorize the data into expenditures, family composition, household head data, and property information. Upon categorization: (a) the categories which shows the best correlation to the total household income will be selected to create a model based on the data in that category; (b) for each category, one data column will be selected that best represents the category to be used to create a model.
