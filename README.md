This repository contains the analytics pipeline for the Filipino Family Income and Expenditures dataset, acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) which was gathered by the Philippine Statistics Authority. The data contains 40,000 observations with 60 variables which includes household income, expenditures, household head information, property details, assets, and family composition. To make the analysis more tractable, the data was grouped by region, showcasing the economic differences across the country.


## Preliminaries

#### Problem Statement

#### Hypothesis


#### Objectives
1. Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset to extract valuable insights regarding regional patterns and trends concerning household income and expenditures.
2. Identify and analyze the primary drivers of household income specific to each region, contributing to a deeper understanding of regional socio-economic dynamics.
3. Construct a robust predictive model for household income by leveraging relevant variables from the dataset, considering regional variations to enhance model accuracy and applicability.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights that will guide predictive model building. One of the main strategies of this project was categorize the data into expenditures, family composition, household head data, and property information. Upon categorization: (a) the categories which shows the best correlation to the total household income will be selected to create a model based on the data in that category; (b) for each category, one data column will be selected that best represents the category to be used to create a model.
